# CLAUDE.md - Project conventions for pyrlm-runtime

## Project overview

Minimal runtime for Recursive Language Models (RLMs). Python 3.12+, MIT license.

## Commands

- **Install deps**: `uv sync`
- **Run all tests**: `uv run pytest`
- **Run specific test file**: `uv run pytest tests/test_env_monty.py -v`
- **Run single test**: `uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::TestClass::test_name -v`
- **Lint**: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/`
- **Format**: `uv run ruff format src/ tests/`
- **Build**: `uv build`

```

## Code style

- Formatter/linter: **ruff** (line-length=100, target py312)
- Quote style: double quotes
- Type hints: use `from __future__ import annotations` in all files
- Commit messages: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)

## Testing conventions

- Framework: **pytest**
- Tests that require `pydantic-monty`: use `@pytest.mark.skipif(not MONTY_AVAILABLE, ...)`
- Use `FakeAdapter` (from `pyrlm_runtime.adapters`) for RLM integration tests

### Regression tests rule

When fixing a bug or correcting a behavior, always add a regression test that would fail if the bug were reintroduced. Propose the test proactively without waiting for the user to ask.

## Documentation rule

When a change adds, renames, deprecates, or alters the behavior of any public
interface (an `RLM` / `Policy` field, an adapter argument, a REPL function, a
doc tool, a retrieval method) or a user-facing default, update the relevant
documentation **in the same change, proactively, without waiting for the user
to ask**. This means at minimum:

- The **README** (quick-reference parameter lists, dedicated sections, code
  examples) wherever the changed symbol or behavior appears.
- The **docstring / inline comment** on the field or function itself.

Treat docs as part of the change's definition of done, alongside tests. A change
that ships code without its doc update is incomplete.

## REPL backends

Two interchangeable backends via `REPLProtocol`:

- `"python"` (default): PythonREPL using `exec()` with whitelist sandbox
- `"monty"`: MontyREPL using pydantic-monty (Rust interpreter, secure)

Both expose: `exec(code) -> ExecResult`, `get(name)`, `set(name, value)`

## Key patterns

- **Variable capture in MontyREPL**: AST-based detection of assignments, append capture dict, extract from result
- **Object proxy for MontyREPL**: complex objects (e.g. Context) registered via `_register_object` -- methods become external functions with `{name}__{method}` naming, AST rewrites `ctx.method()` -> `ctx__method()`

## Design constraints

### This library is generic — domain logic belongs in consumers

pyrlm-runtime provides primitives: RLM loop, REPL sandbox, Context, retrieval, doc tools, policy enforcement. It must not contain domain-specific logic (financial extraction, Spanish text parsing, banking heuristics, etc.). That belongs in consumers like `banking-rlm`.

### When changes to this library are appropriate

- A **missing primitive** that cannot be composed from existing ones in a consumer
- A **general-purpose improvement** that benefits any RLM consumer, not just one
- A **bug fix** in existing behavior
- An **additive change** — do not break existing interfaces

### Be conservative with retrieval.py and doctools/

These are the most used integration points. Before modifying:

1. Check whether the gap can be solved with existing filter DSL or function composition
2. If a new function is needed, ensure it follows the existing naming and return-value conventions
3. Add tests that use `FakeAdapter` to verify the new behavior without hitting real ES or PDFs

## Empirical research methodology

This applies when the user proposes **measuring, benchmarking, or comparing
approaches** (keywords: "probar", "medir", "benchmark", "experimento",
"comparar contra baseline", "ver si mejora"). It does NOT apply to normal
coding tasks (bug fixes, refactors, new features).

When triggered, follow this sequence:

1. **Hypothesis first.** State what you expect to happen and why, before
   running anything. One sentence is enough.
2. **Pre-commit to a decision rule.** Define the success threshold _before_
   seeing results (e.g. "if Δ NDCG ≥ 0.010, update the article; otherwise
   document as ablation"). This prevents interpreting results retroactively.
3. **Fix the baseline.** Identify the exact prior number to beat (run, N,
   cache status, model). Never compare against an approximate memory.
4. **Run with cache OFF.** Publishable numbers require fresh LLM calls.
   Never report numbers from cached runs as final.
5. **Document the result regardless of outcome.** Failures and regressions
   belong in `docs/obliq-bench/OBLIQ-EXPERIMENTS.md` alongside wins. A
   refuted hypothesis is a result.
6. **Apply the decision rule mechanically.** If the result is below threshold,
   say so explicitly. Do not promote a result to headline because it is "close
   enough."
